## Introduction

ImageKit React SDK provides a simple way to integrate ImageKit.io with your React applications. It allows you to easily:
- Render images and video with automatic optimization and responsive sizes.
- Apply transformations to images and videos using URL parameters.
- Apply powerful AI-powered image transformations e.g. background removal, generative fill, object cropping, and more.

## Installation

You can install the SDK in your project using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @imagekit/react
```

## TypeScript support

The SDK is written in TypeScript, offering first-class TypeScript support. Enjoy excellent type safety and IntelliSense in your IDE. You can use it in your TypeScript projects without any additional configuration.

To enable type checking in JavaScript projects, add `//@ts-check` at the top of your JavaScript files. This will activate type checking in your IDE.
